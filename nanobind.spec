%description
nanobind is a small binding library that exposes C++ types in Python and vice
versa. It is reminiscent of Boost.Python and pybind11 and uses near-identical
syntax.
In contrast to these existing tools, nanobind is more efficient: bindings
compile in a shorter amount of time, produce smaller binaries, and have
better runtime performance.

More concretely, benchmarks show up to ~4× faster compile time, ~5× smaller
binaries, and ~10× lower runtime overheads compared to pybind11. nanobind also
outperforms Cython in important metrics (3-12× binary size reduction, 1.6-4×
compilation time reduction, similar runtime performance).
